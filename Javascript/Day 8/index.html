    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting
        of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of
        Peter has gone from a high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere 
        in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the 
        Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc 
        spanning 2012â€“2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Marvel has
        also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man
        2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate 
        Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate universe; 
        and Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the 
        mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superher
        o in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity during the Secret Wars event, where
         he sometimes works alongside the mainline version of Peter.
